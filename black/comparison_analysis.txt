Comparison Analysis – Black

Manual tests exhibit significantly higher coverage and better
organization, reflecting deep understanding of Black's formatting rules.

AI-generated tests are concise and faster to produce but lack
integration scenarios and fail to cover complex formatting behavior.

Conclusion:
AI-generated tests are currently insufficient as a standalone strategy
for complex developer tools like Black.
